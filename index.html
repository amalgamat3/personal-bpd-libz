            <h3>More info about Splitting</h3>
            <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/bpd-splitting-5101493#toc-triggers-for-bpd-splitting">Verywell Health
            </a>
            <p class="info"> Splitting is triggered by anything that causes a person with BPD to take an extreme emotional viewpoint.
            The trigger could be something that seems harmless or “innocent” but is enough to spur emotions that a person with BPD is not able to handle.
                <br>
            Splitting is a defense mechanism used to counter emotions a person with BPD cannot control.</p>

            <p class="info">
                Splitting is an unconscious attempt to safeguard ego and prevent anxiety. Splitting often leads to extreme — and sometimes destructive — behavior and personal turmoil in relationships.

        <p class="info">
            It’s important to note that <strong>understanding</strong> BPD triggers won’t necessarily make the feelings go away. However, by increasing awareness, you can develop coping mechanisms and learn how to deal with BPD.
